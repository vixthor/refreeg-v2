      At RefreeG, transparency is our top priority, and we achieve this
      using blockchain technology. With blockchain, every donation is
      permanently recorded on a secure, public ledger, so donors can track
      their contributions in real time.
      <br />
      <br />
      This ensures complete visibility—donors always know where their money
      is going and how it’s being used. There’s no risk of funds being
      mismanaged or hidden fees sneaking in. Smart contracts—automated
      agreements on the blockchain—make sure that money is only released
      when certain conditions are met, adding an extra layer of security.
      <br />
      <br />
      This prevents fraud and ensures donations truly reach the right
      people. We use Polygon, a fast and cost-effective blockchain, to make
      transactions smooth and affordable. This way, everyone
      involved—donors, beneficiaries, and organizations—can trust the
      system, knowing that every step is open and verifiable.
      <br />
      <br />
      RefreeG is built to be a trustworthy platform that makes a real
      difference in education funding.

        experience that ensures every donation’s journey is visible and
        verifiable.
        <br />
        <br />
        From the moment a donation is made, RefreeG’s system records each
        transaction onto the blockchain, creating a transparent trail that’s
        accessible through our user-friendly dashboard. Here, donors can see
        exactly where and how their contributions are being applied to each
        cause, updated in real-time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our platform breaks down the progress of individual initiatives,
        displaying specific milestones, current funding levels, and ongoing
        updates from cause creators. With this tracking, donors don’t just
        give; they’re continuously engaged and informed on how their support
        directly affects causes they care about—whether it’s providing
        resources, education, vocational training, or support for victims of
        gender-based violence.
        <br />
        <br />
        This real-time tracking is designed to build trust and give our
        supporters peace of mind, reinforcing the impact they’re making toward
        socioeconomic growth. RefreeG’s commitment to clarity and
        accountability empowers every user to see the difference they’re
        making, creating a unique donation experience built on transparency
        and trust.
