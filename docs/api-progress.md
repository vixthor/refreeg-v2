## Progress Log

### [March 25, 2026] - Phase 1: Foundation (API Key Infrastructure)

- **Developer Onboarding:** Integrated `developer` as a new account type in user profiles.
- **API Key Security:** Implemented SHA-256 hashing for API keys (storing only hashes) and secure generation of `rg_live_sk_...` keys.
- **Authentication Middleware:** Built `validateApiKey` utility for unified API authentication.

### [March 25, 2026] - Phase 2: Campaign API

- **Isolated Infrastructure:** Created the `api_campaigns` table to separate API-driven campaigns from the main site.
- **Lifecycle Endpoints:** Developed `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `/pause`, and `/resume` endpoints for full control.
- **Paystack Integration:** Built automatic Paystack sub-account creation logic for automated payouts.

### [March 25, 2026] - Phase 3: Donation & Payment API

- **Transaction Initialization:** Built `POST /api/bot/donations/initialize` supporting platform fees and optional tips.
- **Payment Verification:** Developed `GET /api/bot/donations/verify/[reference]` with secure transaction checks and balance updates.

### [March 25, 2026] - Phase 4: Webhook System

- **Database Infrastructure:** Created `api_webhooks` and `api_webhook_logs` tables with full RLS protection.
- **Secure Dispatching:** Built a robust `dispatchWebhook` utility using HMAC-SHA256 signatures for payload integrity.

### [March 25, 2026] - Phase 5 & 5.1: Campaign Reporting & Consolidation

- **Consolidated API Surface:** Pluralized all reporting endpoints to follow RESTful standards (e.g., `/api/bot/campaigns/[id]/reports`).
- **Reporting Infrastructure:** Implemented the `api_campaign_reports` table with full RLS, linking fraud/abuse reports to specific campaigns and developers.
- **Admin Resolve Tools:** Developed the `takeDownApiCampaign` server action, allowing RefreeG admins to instantly deactivate fraudulent campaigns created via API.
- **Webhook Integration:** Automated `campaign.reported` and `campaign.taken_down` webhook dispatches for real-time developer notification.

### [March 25, 2026] - Phase 6: Standardized API Response Format

- **Response Utilities:** Created `successResponse`, `errorResponse`, and `paginatedResponse` helpers in `lib/api/response.ts` to enforce a 100% consistent JSON structure.
- **Unified Error System:** Defined a comprehensive `ApiErrorCode` enum (e.g., `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `INVALID_API_KEY`) to facilitate robust error handling in SDKs.
- **Global Refactoring:** Updated all 25+ route handlers under `app/api/bot/` to utilize these helpers, ensuring standardized HTTP status codes and response bodies.

### [March 25, 2026] - Phase 11: Security Hardening

- **Advanced Rate Limiting:** Implemented an identifier-aware limiter in `middleware/api-auth.ts` that tracks requests by API Key (for authenticated devs) or IP address (for general traffic).
- **CORS & Preflight:** Configured a global CORS policy with native `OPTIONS` support for all `/api/bot/*` routes, enabling secure cross-origin SDK integrations.
- **Strict Zod Validation:** Enforced deep validation schemas for all incoming payloads, specifically hardening `bank_account` and `nested multimedia` arrays.
- **Audit Logging:** Integrated `logApiRequest` utility across the entire API surface, capturing telemetry, latency, and error rates for the admin monitoring dashboard.

### [March 25, 2026] - Phase 7: Developer Documentation Site
- **Public API Docs:** Created a dedicated Developer API section within the public documentation site at `/docs/get-started`.
- **Interactive Playground:** Built a high-fidelity, in-browser API testing tool (`ApiPlayground.tsx`) allowing developers to test endpoints with sandbox keys.
- **Detailed References:** Populated the documentation with cURL examples and authentication guides.

### [March 25, 2026] - Phase 10: Testing & Sandbox
- **Postman Collection:** Generated `RefreeG_API_v1.postman_collection.json` with pre-configured requests for all endpoints.
- **E2E Automation:** Developed `e2e-api-test.ts` to simulate a complete developer integration cycle from creation to split-payment donation.
- **Sandbox Validation:** Verified that test keys correctly route to Paystack's sandbox environment.

### [March 25, 2026] - Phase 12: Launch Preparation
- **Final Audit:** Completed a full system walkthrough and confirmed alignment with the Technical Design Document (TDD).
- **Master Walkthrough:** Compiled a project-wide implementation history for final stakeholder review.
- **Project Readiness:** Formally marked the API infrastructure as **Production Ready**.

### [2026-03-27] - Documentation Professionalization (Phases 5, 6, 11 Hardening)
- **Engineer:** Antigravity (AI)
- **Standalone Architecture**: Decoupled the API documentation portal (`/docs/api`) from the global site layout for a focused, premium developer experience (Phase 5).
- **Schema Synchronization**: Updated all documentation parameters and playground models to the high-fidelity flat structure (e.g., `bank_account_number`) to match production Zod schemas.
- **Responsive Navigation**: Refactored `ApiSidebar` and integrated a mobile-first navigation overlay, ensuring full accessibility across devices (Phase 6).
- **Interactive Playground**: Synced `ApiPlayground` with the flattened data model and corrected endpoint paths (e.g., `/api/bot/campaigns/categories`).
- **Technical Refinement**: Population of "Best Practices" (Security, Idempotency) and "Error Reference" (ApiErrorCode) sections (Phase 11).
- **Update [March 28, 2026]**:
    - **Modular Documentation**: Refactored `ApiDocsPage` into specialized components (`EndpointCampaigns`, `EndpointDonations`, etc.) for better maintainability and navigation.
    - **Banks API Implementation**: Created `/api/bot/banks` for independent bank profile management.
    - **Decoupled Architecture**: Updated Campaign API to support `bank_id`, allowing developers to reuse verified settlement profiles.
    - **Blueprint Validation Clarity**: Enhanced documentation for the AI Blueprint Validation endpoint to support autonomous agent error-correction loops.
    - **Dashboard Integration**: Added direct navigation links between the Documentation Portal and Developer Dashboard.

### [March 29, 2026] - AI Blueprint Validation Refinement
- **Documentation Update**: Updated `SectionValidateAi` in `EndpointMisc.tsx` to provide a clearer, more concise explanation of the validation dry-run process for AI agents.
